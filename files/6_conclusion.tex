\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch6_conclusion}
We have presented an area efficient FPGA overlay with a linear connection of TM FUs based on the Xilinx DSP48E1.
Interleaving data transfer with instruction execution significantly reduces the II with a resulting increase in throughput.
Introducing write-back into the FU design allows the overlay depth to be fixed. 
%Introducing write-back into the FU design and modifying the scheduling strategy allows the overlay depth to be fixed.
This eliminates the need to reconfigure the overlay if the application kernel changes, making the overlay more general. These changes significantly reduce the latency with just a small decrease in throughput.
The V3 overlay has the best performance, as for a fixed data bandwidth, it has comparable throughput with a significantly reduced latency.
